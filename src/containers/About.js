            My name is Claude Hyppolite Jr and I am currently a student in Full
            Stack Web Developer Bootcamp with a few projects under my belt. My
            main background is in database development and design (primarily SQL
            Server) but I finally decided to take the plunge and dive into the
            world of web development
