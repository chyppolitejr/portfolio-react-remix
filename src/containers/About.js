              My name is Claude Hyppolite Jr and I am currently a student in
              Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp with a few projects under my
              belt. My main background is in database development and design
              (primarily SQL Server) but I finally decided to take the plunge
              and dive into the world of web development
